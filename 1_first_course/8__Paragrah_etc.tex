\section{Introduction and Related Work}

Representation of the environment of a mobile robot is of
fundamental importance. If there is no prior information about the
environment the the robot has to build this during the exploration.
Over the past decade there has been a lot of work on map building
for mobile robots. Some approaches use the landmarks (installed or
natural) as a reference for map building while some use the relative
positions of landmarks as invariant features for map building\marginpar{Could you please insert a video here}.
