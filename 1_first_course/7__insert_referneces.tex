\section{Introduction and Related Work}
Representation of the environment of a mobile robot is of
fundamental importance\cite{monkey}. If there is no prior information about the
environment the the robot has to build this during the exploration.
Over the past decade there has been a lot of work on map building
for mobile robots. Some approaches use the landmarks (installed or
natural) as a reference for map building while some use the relative
positions of landmarks as invariant features for map building\cite{monkey2}.
